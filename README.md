This script automatically installs and updates the latest releases for [stationhub](https://github.com/unitystation/stationhub), unitystation's offical launcher.

This script generally shouldn't exist as we do support stuff like flathub on Linux, but if you're too lazy to open your package manager or browser to update the launcher; this script will automatically fetch the latest release and update the game for you.

> **Warning**
> This script has not been tested on MacOS. As a result, some of the output files might be misplaced or wont even download.
